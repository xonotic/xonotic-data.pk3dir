add g_mh_startitem cvars to the balance files

+2 waypoint modes, 
waypoints for runners on round start always and waypoints for hunters when there are 3 or more hunters
only runners can see other runners but hunters don't see others

rename teams as far as possible

find a proper damage type for tagging instead of death by camping as it doesn't show kill notifications or text

add a cvar to disable teleportating the first spawned hunter to where last runner got tagged on round reset

gamemode icon (WIP)

more dynamicity for the code :)

add more TODO: notes

fix waypoint visibility, currently they are always visible to everyone. Fix them to not be visible for spectators of that player.


Message for Jaska:

Hi, Jaska, thank you for the great work, I returned the stuff as should. 
I was doing 'Prop Hunt' experiments after MH was completed, I shouldn't have touched the branch too much. 
I consider leaving MH as completed, feel free to open a MR about that. The gamemode looks standardized.
Apologies for my experiments.

Sincerely, 
LegendGuard
