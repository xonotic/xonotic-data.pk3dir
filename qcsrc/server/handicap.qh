// Handicap is used to make the game harder for strong players and easier for
// weak players. Values greater than 1 make the game harder and values less than
// 1 make the game easier. Right now handicap only affects damage. There are 2
// types of handicap: voluntary and forced. Voluntary handicap can be set via
// cl_handicap cvars. For obvious reasons, it can't be less than 1. Forced
// handicap can be set by server mutators. The total handicap is the product of
// voluntary and forced handicap.
// Both handicaps are separated into _take and _give so that mutators and
// players are able to nerf their damage output or increase intake
// without changing the other.

/// \brief Initializes handicap to its default value.
/// \param[in,out] player Player to initialize.
/// \return No return.
void Handicap_Initialize(entity player);

/// \brief Returns the voluntary handicap of the player.
/// \param[in] player Player to check.
/// \param[in] receiving Whether handicap is for receiving or dealing.
/// \return Voluntary handicap of the player.
float Handicap_GetVoluntaryHandicap(entity player, bool receiving);

/// \brief Returns the forced handicap of the player.
/// \param[in] player Player to check.
/// \param[in] receiving Whether handicap is for receiving or dealing.
