/*QUAKED spawnfunc_tdm_team (0 .5 .8) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 32)
Team declaration for TDM gameplay, this allows you to decide what team names and control point models are used in your map.
Note: If you use spawnfunc_tdm_team entities you must define at least 2!  However, unlike domination, you don't need to make a blank one too.
Keys:
"netname" Name of the team (for example Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Life, Death, Offense, Defense, etc)...
"cnt" Scoreboard color of the team (for example 4 is red and 13 is blue)... */
