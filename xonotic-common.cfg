// Xonotic version (formatted for machines)

// general policy: previous release has "best effort" support, older releases are unsupported,
// but gameversion_min doesn't have to be bumped with every release (eg: a minor patch release)
// bump when clients become incompatible or any other perfectly good reason
// (e.g. game data incompatibility, engine version incompatibility, etc.)
// note: this automatically filters the server browser, clients of the new
// version won't see old servers, and clients of the old version won't see new
// servers either
//
// e.g. Xonotic 1.5.1 RC1 will be 15101
set g_xonoticversion git "Xonotic version (formatted for humans)" // script-ignore

gameversion_max 65535 // future versions should nag players to update

// compatibility guideline:
//   version a.b.c   = a0b0c
//   gameversion_min = a0(b-1)00 // show servers of the previous "line"
//   gameversion_max = a0(b+1)99 // show servers of the next "line"
// so, for a given gameversion, _min and _max calculate as follows:
//   gameversion_min = (gameversion / 100) * 100 - 100
//   gameversion_max = (gameversion / 100) * 100 + 199
