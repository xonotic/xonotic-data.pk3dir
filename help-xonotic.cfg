set help_msg_6 "Notice what other players do differently. Often winning or losing comes down to more than accuracy and evading the other player's shots. Movement, map knowledge and items are equally important."
set help_msg_7 "If others are better than you, it does not mean they cheat. Save such complaints for when you have more experience and know what kind of funky stuff is possible."
set help_msg_8 "Listen and remember that the enemy is listening too. Footsteps and item pickups make sounds that can give away your position."
set help_msg_9 "Use the radar to see where your teammates are. Try to time returning your flag with your FC (flag carrier) arriving at your base so enemies can't steal it again before the FC caps."

set help_msg_11 "Protect your FC (flag carrier) at all costs! Save health and armor for them, they need it more than you!"
set help_msg_12 "Use the Blaster to make very high jumps. Just look 'at your feet' and press fire. Other explosive weapons work too but do a lot more damage."
set help_msg_13 "Be friendly and helpful to other players! Being angry at others' mistakes is understandable, but nobody is perfect. Try to use calm words when telling them how to correct their mistake."

set help_msg_26 "The MachineGun's ^1secondary ${help_cfg_prefix}burst firemode has no spread, use it as a cheap Vortex substitute at long range."

set help_msg_28 "The Electro has a combo attack. Fire the primary mode at the balls from the secondary mode for a huge and powerful explosion."
set help_msg_29 "The Crylink's primary fire bounces. Both firemodes pull your enemies, making it a great tool for stopping enemy FCs (flag carriers)."
set help_msg_30 "The Vortex is one of the most powerful weapons in Xonotic. It has barely any competition at long range and can serve as a great combo weapon at mid and short range. Put some effort into mastering it, it'll pay off."
set help_msg_31 "The Hagar is a powerful weapon in enclosed spaces, to use it effectively aim at the enemy's feet."
set help_msg_32 "Guide your Devastator rockets by holding primary fire and turning or moving. Secondary fire makes the rocket(s) explode."
set help_msg_33 "The Arc is a strong lightning beam, which bends slighty if you move your mouse. The secondary firemode is very strong but short. Both firemodes also heal teammates if you shoot at them."
