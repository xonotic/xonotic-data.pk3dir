set help_msg_12 "You can use the Blaster and most explosive weapons to jump around. Just look 'at your feet' and press fire. If you also jump at the same time, you get even higher."
set help_msg_13 "Be friendly and helpful to other players! Being angry at others' mistakes is understandable, but nobody is perfect. Try to use calm words when telling them how to correct their mistake."

set help_msg_27 "The Mortar is a good all around gun but takes some practice to aim it, because of the projectile's curve."
